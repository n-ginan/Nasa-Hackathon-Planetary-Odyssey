            <h1>TOI-1231 b</h1>
            <p class="paragraph1">90 light years away from Earth, there exists the Neptune-like exoplanet, TOI-1231 which was discovered in 2021 through a transit.  This planet was discovered by a large team of astronomers led by exoplanet researchers,  Dr. Jennifer Burt  from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Professor Diana Dragomir from University of New Mexico . TOI-1231 net is 15.4 times the mass of Earth while also being three and a half times bigger than Earth. It can orbit around its star, a red dwarf star smaller but older than our solar system’s Sun, in just 24.2 days.  Astronomers also describe it as one of the “coolest” smaller exoplanets that has a temperature comparable to Earth’s at 134 degrees Fahrenheit or 57 degrees Celsius, despite being relatively close to its star. This is due to its star being cooler and less bright too compared to our other stars like our Sun.

            <p class="paragraph2">Astronomers are speculating that TOI-1231 b comprises of a gaseous world with a rich atmosphere. Bringing that into light, astronomers allegedly saw evidences of clous being existent in the said planet. However, despite having an atmosphere and a fairly cooler range of temperatures in the said planet, it was cited that this exoplanet is not habitable due to its size.  Jennifer Burt, a NASA JPL scientist stated that further observations of  TOI-1231 b  in the future will help identity how common or rare it is for water clouds to form in these type of planets.
