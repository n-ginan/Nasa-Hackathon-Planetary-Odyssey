## Story Outline

A ripple of unease surges through me as I recall the visions. The nightmarish glimpses of an impending cataclysm from the Andor Cluster, a galaxy so diquiztant it exists only in hushed legends. The Voidstorm is coming—an endless surge of cosmic entropy, a black wave that consumes stars, devours planets, and bends time itself until all that remains is a hollow, lifeless expanse.

I have been tasked by the High Council of Orion's Gate to seek out the Sigma Stone, to venture beyond the Known Realms and into the Unknown—where space-time warps, and exoplanets float like forgotten islands amidst seas of dark matter. No one has dared to traverse this far. But I must, for the stone is not merely a tool; it is a tether to the past and a beacon for the future.

Beneath the surface of an uncharted planet lies its resting place, concealed within labyrinthine caverns of molten rock and ancient sentinels, creatures that have slept longer than the birth of suns. And I, a lone traveler amongst the stars, must confront them. Each step toward the Sigma Stone brings me closer to the precipice, where the line between life and obliteration fades.

There is no guarantee I will return, but it is said that those who touch the Sigma Stone hear the whisper of the universe itself—its secrets, its beginnings, its end. Perhaps it will grant me the strength to push back the Voidstorm. Perhaps it will grant me something far darker. Or perhaps, it will leave me as nothing more than stardust, scattered among the ruins of forgotten worlds.

But the future of the galaxy is at stake, and as I gaze out at the infinite cosmos from the viewport of my starship, I cannot help but feel the weight of it all. The stars seem quieter now, as if they, too, are holding their breath. Waiting.
And so I venture, not for glory, not for power—but to stave off the dark end that waits beyond the edge of time.

The Sigma Stone beckons.

### Prologue

In the far reaches of the cosmos, where the known universe blurs into the unknown, Neil deGrasse Tyson stands at the helm of an advanced spacecraft, the Starmapper. Once a humble science communicator, he now shoulders the fate of not just Earth, but the entire galaxy. The High Council of Orion’s Gate, knowing his unparalleled knowledge of the cosmos, has entrusted him with a mission unlike any other: to locate the ancient Sigma Stone, buried deep beneath alien worlds. The stone is the last hope to stave off the Voidstorm—a cosmic force that threatens to unravel the fabric of the universe itself.

Neil had never imagined this would be his life. Traveling between distant exoplanets, navigating star systems long left to myth. But here he is, tasked with venturing to the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, starting with the exoplanets TOI-1231 b, Wolf 1061 c, GJ 1002 b, Proxima Centauri b, Epsilon Eridani B, and Gliese 832 C. Each of these planets holds secrets, challenges, and fragments of the clues necessary to unlock the Sigma Stone’s resting place.

As he steps into the Starmapper, the NPC pilot—a grizzled veteran named Captain Ryn—greets him with a wry smile. "Ready for the unknown, Tyson? The first stop is TOI-1231 b. We’ve plotted a course, but be warned—these planets aren’t just pretty science experiments. They’ve got guardians…"

The map of the galaxy flickers to life on the ship’s console, each planet gleaming like a distant beacon of hope. But not all planets are accessible yet. Neil has to unlock them one by one, uncovering their mysteries, scanning their surfaces, and battling the forces that guard the ancient knowledge.

Neil’s journey will be perilous, but with his vast knowledge of the cosmos and the guidance of Captain Ryn, the Sigma Stone might just be within reach. Yet, the question remains—will it be enough to stop the Voidstorm, or is there something even more dangerous lurking in the dark recesses of the galaxy? Only time—and the stars—will tell.
